## üéØ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an interactive and accessible chess game that can be fully played using voice commands. Traditional chess platforms require mouse or touch input, which may be limiting or inconvenient for some users. By incorporating speech recognition, we aim to enhance accessibility and modernize the way people interact with digital chess.

Our app will support:
- Voice-based piece movement
- Standard and special moves (castling, promotion, etc.)
- A visual game board
- Feedback on invalid commands
